## Task III

- Implement tests

## Open questions

- Remove interfaces/exceptions from class diagram?
- Export-modules:
    - name `<module>.export` &rarr; problem due to dot and resulting package naming conventions?
    - (not export) modules have all dependencies of export modules + respective own exp. module. Is that even wanted?
    - In the future: Is `.export` to be the module to be added as dependency? If so: how do we get the impl (`<XyImpl>.java`)?
