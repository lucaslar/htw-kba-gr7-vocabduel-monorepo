# Todos

## Task II

- Remove interfaces/exceptions from class diagram

## Task III

- Implement tests
- Show interfaces in diagram on "lollipops"
- Regenerate both diagrams

## Optional
- Add Constructors to java classes? just an idea ..

- check if gameId already exists?? -> new interface method in game admin List<VocabduelGame> getGameById()
